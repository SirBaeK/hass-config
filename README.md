                                   Home-Assistant â€“ Python 3.6 Virtual Environment
                                                        AUTOMATIZER


Automate dependency downloading, install all the necessary packages, and launch Home-Assistant as a new homeassistant user in Python 3.6 Virtual Environment v / opt / homeassistant. Basically, it's the official installer from the site. But sometimes there are some of my official improvements that can / must be modified.

Irregularly  updated, not tweaked, this configuration work for me nice :)

Use, Modify,Tweak, Its OpenSource, for Everybody ...
